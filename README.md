## 📌 Overview

This project demonstrates how to implement **middleware in an Express.js application** for two main purposes:

1. **Request Logging:** Logging HTTP request details like method, URL, and timestamp.
2. **JSON Body Parsing:** Automatically parsing JSON data from incoming requests using the built-in `express.json()` middleware.

Middleware plays a crucial role in Express apps by **pre-processing requests before they reach the route handlers**, making it easier to implement features like logging, validation, authentication, etc.
